# todoMVC
As one of the first coding projects in the Watch And Code curriculum,
students are asked to strip jQuery out line by line from TODO MVC codebase.
This exercise proved enormously useful as a learning tool for understanding how Javascript interacts with external libraries.  This lesson also reinforced the idea that when learning a language it is extremely helpful to study the rules and documentation, and to study the ways that helper functions are used to extend the capabilities of the native codebase.
